            Capcom has revealed what will be included with the Deluxe Editions of Monster Hunter Rise on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as pre-order bonuses. What was once a Nintendo Switch exclusive release is finally making its way to other consoles. On January 20, Monster Hunter Rise will launch on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Buyers will have the option, just like their Switch and PC predecessors, to purchase Deluxe Editions of the upcoming release.
        </p>

            When Monster Hunter Rise first launched on the Nintendo Switch in 2021, it also had a Deluxe Edition, released in both physical and digital format. Unsurprisingly, the Deluxe Edition was also released for Steam in early 2022, though it didn't receive a physical edition. PlayStation and Xbox players, as well as Switch and PC players, will be pleased to hear that the Deluxe Editions for their platforms will feature exactly the same content. There are no new benefits or extra rewards.
        </p>

            The PlayStation and Xbox Deluxe Editions of Monster Hunter Rise will include a variety of cosmetics and digital content that otherwise doesn't impact gameplay. There are three layered armor pieces, the Kamurai Hunter set, the Shuriken Collar Palamute piece, and the Fish Collar Palico piece, all cosmetics that can be layered over players' stat-influencing armor. There's also a "Jump" emote set, a Samurai pose emote set, a Kabuki face paint character customization, and lastly the Izuchi Tail hairstyle.

            As for pre-orders, there are two additional cosmetics as well as a piece of equipment. In this case, the equipment does help with gameplay, but only during the early stages of the game. The cosmetics are the Palamute Retriever layered armor and the Palico Forest Cat layered armor, with the equipment being the Novice Talisman. This bonus is only available for those that purchase Monster Hunter Rise or its Deluxe Edition prior to January 20.

            The Deluxe Edition of Monster Hunter Rise is the same price across all PlayStation and Xbox platforms. The base version of the game costs $39.99, while the Deluxe Editions cost $10 extra at $49.99. This is very close to the same price the game is currently available at on both PC and Nintendo Switch.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For Monster Hunter fans on PlayStation and Xbox that have remained patient over the past year and a half, Monster Hunter Rise is arriving soon. Despite the delay, Capcom continues to provide robust content updates for the game, so PlayStation and Xbox players will be able to jump into fresh new content even after starting the game late. The Deluxe Editions and pre-order bonuses, for those that want them, can help make that start all the more enjoyable. It should be more than enough to keep fans busy until Capcom's next Monster Hunter game is announced.
