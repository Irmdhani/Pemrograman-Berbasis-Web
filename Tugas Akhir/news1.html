            One Apex Legends fan has taken their passion for the game and used 
            it to recreate Caustic’s Nox Gas Trap in real life. While the Apex 
            Legends roster has swelled to 23 characters, some of the original eight 
            Legends that came with the game at launch are still iconic, such as Caustic 
            and his toxic traps.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As his name suggests, Caustic, also known as the Toxic Trapper, has a lineup 
            of defensive abilities themed around noxious gas. While he is not very effective 
            in large open areas, he can be challenging to deal with in close-quarters combat. 
            This is due to Caustics' Nox Gas Traps and Nox Gas Grenade. Recently, one fan chose 
            to make a piece of the Legend’s kit in real life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In a post on Reddit, a user known as ZRE1990 shared a video of a recent creation they 
            had 3D-printed based on Apex Legends. Specifically, the Reddit user had decided to make 
            a life-sized replica of one of Caustic’s Nox Gas Traps, and the results were nothing 
            short of impressive. The video recorded by the creator revealed the attention to detail 
            in the design. Seemingly every detail was recreated perfectly, from the red and black 
            color pattern to the bronze-tinted cap. Furthermore, a biohazard sign was visible on 
            the side of the canister. The creator even had a Nessie plushie in the video for good 
            measure, which helped reveal the scale of the creation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Even though the design alone was noteworthy, ZRE1990 went a step further by making 
            the replica functional. While this Nox Gas Trap replica did not produce toxic fumes, 
            the video from the creator revealed that it could shoot out clouds of fog. In addition, 
            the opening at the top of the canister gave off a green glow, adding to its realism.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Unsurprisingly, this creation made by ZRE1990 has caught the attention of numerous 
            members of the Apex Legends community on Reddit. The replica of the Nox Gas Trap has 
            become so popular that it has managed to gain more than 28.5K upvotes in only a day on 
            the platform. In addition to this 3D-printed Nox Gas Trap, users pointed out that 
            ZRE1990 has made a number of other incredible creations in the past. Some other items 
            they have created based on Apex Legends include a dilapidated Pathfinder head and a 
            creepy Octane head for Halloween.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It goes without saying that this latest creation by ZRE1990 proves they are more than 
            capable of creating convincing replicas of objects based on video games. With this Nox Gas 
            Trap completed, it will be interesting to see if they make more items from the Apex Legends 
            universe. While there is no shortage of options for what they could 3D print next, it would 
            no doubt be exciting to see things like Lifeline’s D.O.C. Heal Drone and Rampart’s Emplaced 
            Minigun, aka “Sheila,” recreated in the real world.
